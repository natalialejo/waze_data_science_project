## Project Overview
As a **Data Analyst at Waze**, I'm developing a comprehensive project proposal to predict and prevent user churn. This project focuses on analyzing user behavior patterns to help Waze retain users and optimize the navigation experience.

## Business Challenge
Waze needs to understand and predict user churn to:
- **Increase user retention** and reduce monthly churn rates
- **Identify high-risk users** before they leave the platform  
- **Develop targeted strategies** to engage users proactively
- **Optimize user experience** based on data-driven insights

## Methodology: PACE Framework
- **Plan**: Define project goals, stakeholders, and success metrics
- **Analyze**: Explore user data and identify churn patterns
- **Construct**: Build machine learning model for churn prediction
- **Execute**: Implement model and create actionable recommendations
